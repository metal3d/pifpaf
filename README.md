# PifPaf log

Simple command to log several commands at once in a tiled view in the terminal.

Stop all the command simultaneously with `Ctrl+C`.

Easy, useful.

## Usage

Give the commands as argument (use quotes if needed to identify each command).
And leave the rest to `pifpaf`.

By default, `pifpaf` will display maximum 3 columns. A "flexbox" layout is used, and new rows are added when the number
of commands is greater than the number of columns.

```bash
pifpaf "command1" "command2" "command3"
```

You can specify the number of columns with the `-c` option â€“ you can use 1 to whatever you want. But be careful, the
more columns you have, the more the terminal will be divided, and the output width will be reduced.

```bash
# Example, with 2 columns
pifpaf -c 2 "command1" "command2" "command3"
```

Examples of output:

```bash
pifpiaf \
  "podman run --rm -it nginx" \
  "podman run --rm -it metal3d/xmrig" \
  "dmesg -w"
```

Using `-c 2` to have only 2 columns:

```bash
pifpaf -c 2 \
  "podman run --rm -it nginx" \
  "podman run --rm -it metal3d/xmrig" \
  "dmesg -w"
```

## Installation

There are 4 options to install `pifpaf`:

- From the release page

  Get the release from the [releases page](https://github.com/metal3d/pifpaf/releases/latest) and put it in your `PATH`.
  Select the right binary for your system.

  Of course, **rename it to `pifpaf`**.

- Using `go get`

  You may, also, use `go inteall` if you have Go installed:

  ```bash
  go install github.com/metal3d/pifpaf@latest
  ```

- From source with `podman` (`docker` is planned)

  Build from source doesn't need to have Go installed, we use a container to build the binary.:

  ```bash
  git clone github.com/metal3d/pifpaf && cd pifpaf
  # Recommended to install in your home.
  # Change the PREFIX to install in another location.
  make install PREFIX=~/.local

  # or system-wide
  sudo make install
  ```

## Known issues

> Sometimes, pressing `CTRL+C` does not stop the commands. The terminal doesn't give back the prompt.

It's a known issue, and I'm working on it. But no panic, only press `CTRL+C` again, and it will stop the commands.

> Colors are sometimes not well displayed

It's a limitation of the `tview` library. I'm working on it.

> Some commands need to refresh the screen to display the output, like in `watch`, or for example `top` or `htop`...

At this time, PifPaf does not support this kind of command. It's a "log" tool, not a "monitor" tool. But I try to find a
way to support this kind of command.

> I launched interactive commands, like `vim`, and I can't stop it.

As for the previous issue, PifPaf is not designed to manage interactive commands. It's a "log" tool, not an
"interactive" tool.

## FAQ

> Why the name `pifpaf`?

Because, it's funny.

> I have more complex commands to launch, it's hard to put them in quotes.

You may use a Makefile to store the commands, and use `make XXX` where `XXX` is the target name. You can, also, use
scripts.

> Is it really free?

Yes, it's free. It's under the BSD-3-Clause license. You can use it, modify it, and distribute it as you want. I'm a
historical defender of free software programs, and when I say "free", I mean "as freedom".

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/metal3d/pifpaf/issues) to report a bug, or to ask for a feature. If you want
to fix it, you can fork the project, and make a pull request.

Please, be kind and respectful. I'm a human, and I do my best to make a good project.
